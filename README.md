<h2> 👋 Hi, I’m Elvis Otieno </h2>

I am currently enrolled in the ALX Africa/Holberton School Curriculum and interested in software engineering. Currently, I am working on Python and C programming languages simultaneously. I am also seeking opportunities to collaborate on any open-source project. If you would like to reach me, you can achieve that through my email >> elv.s.earl@gmail.com <<.
